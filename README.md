Natura
======

Natura (*Latin for "Nature"*) is an online ordering system intended for use by small, local food buying groups.

Features
--------
* **Multiple, concurrent order cycles**: Allows for different products to be ordered over different time periods (*ex: A short order cycle for fresh produce, a longer order cycle for grains & meat*)
* **Producer managed inventory**: Producers can login & manage their own inventory
* **Automatic inventory control**: Orders will decrement (or increment) inventory so there won't be orders for more inventory than is available.

Notable omissions
------------------
* **Natura does *not* have any integration with online payment (ie: via PayPal or Google Checkout)**.  Due to the volatile nature of…well…nature, the items a person orders may or may not be in their order.  As a result, groups using the system must handle payment at pickup day, to ensure members only pay for what they get.
* **There is no delivery route management** - The group this software was initially written for only used one pickup point, so I didn't bother to include route management.  It's not on the horizon, but also not out of the picture.
